# Start your own "Can of Books" App

This repository has starter code to begin work on creating your own online bookshelf.

## What can books do?

Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. Build out this code base to create an web app to track what books have impacted you, and what's recommended to read next.

## Use this template

Clone this repo to your own account with the green "Use this template" button. Then, add any collaborators. Now you are ready to start adding features! Deploy your site to let the world know which books have had the greatest impact on you, and what's recommended. Enjoy!

## Team Agreement

### Logistical

1. What hours will you be available to communicate? Armando is 8 am to 9 pm. Charlie 7 am to 7 pm.
2. What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)? We will use Slack and remo.
3. How often will you take breaks? As needed; one 10 minute break every 2 hours.
4. What is your plan if you start to fall behind? Get TA help, contact instructor, and work longer hours if needed.

### Cooperative

1. Make a list of each parson’s strengths. Armando is perseverance and adaptibility. Charlie is problem solving and server-side knowledge
2. How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application? See the project through the end, utilize our resources, and pair programming.
3. In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength? Armando wants to develop better coding skills on the front-end and server-side. Charlie wants to develop a greater understanding of the code and communication.
4. Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development? Make sure we share equal times as the driver and navigator. Meet up in remo and work together to complete tasks.

### Conflict Resolution

1. What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing? Make sure we have equal time as driver navigator, we have equal ACPs, and have equal branch merges.
2. What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute? Communicate as needed and share time as driver and navigator.
3. How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level? Help teach other concepts one is struggling on, and just communicate and make sure we are on the same page.
